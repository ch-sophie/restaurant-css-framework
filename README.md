#### The website is responsive, for small and medium screens.

A page with one Jumbotron and two panels (our story and news).   

_Menu_     
A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.   

_Gallery_        
A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).   

_Restaurant_      
A page about the restaurants (itâ€™s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.   

_Contact_      
A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.
